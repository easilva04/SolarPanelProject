# Solar Panel Project
This project was originally created in July 2022, however, I have since learned much more in my EE and CS curriculum, and I wish to implement what I have learned

# Goals
1. Follow the sun (duh)
   - Stepper vs servo motors for pitch vs yaw
   - wire together and make sure prototype works
   - Finally make sure prototype was working identically or better to original attempt
2. Environmental Optimization
   - Maximize Solar Energy Capture: Improve solar panel alignment and tracking for optimal energy intake.
   - Sustainability Focus: Enhance renewable energy efficiency.
3. Fault Detection
   - Real-time Fault Detection: Implement algorithms to detect and alert users to system faults.
   - Minimize Downtime: Ensure quick response to issues.
4. Data Analysis
   - Collect and Analyze Performance Data: Gather and analyze data to optimize system efficiency.
   - Data Visualization: Provide tools for visualizing trends and insights.
5. User-Friendly Interface
   - Intuitive UI: Design an easy-to-use interface for monitoring and controlling the system.
   - Accessible Controls: Simplify user interaction with the system.
6. Integration and Communication
    - Hybrid System (Raspberry Pi + Arduino): Use a combined setup for hardware control and data processing.
    - Seamless Communication: Ensure reliable data exchange between components.

# To Do:
1. Fix SSH to make sure I can actually edit the thing
2.
