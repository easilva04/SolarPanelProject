# SolarPanelProject
This project was originally created in July 2022, however, I have since learned much more in my EE and CS curriculum, and I wish to implement what I have learned

# Goals
1. Follow the sun (duh)
   - Stepper vs servo motors for pitch vs yaw
   - wire together and make sure prototype works
2. make Raspberry pi talk to Arduino
3. Win
